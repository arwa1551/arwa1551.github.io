# Project 3: Cardiovascular disease prediction

## Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases result in millions of deaths around the globe annually, most of which are avoidable if identified early. Machine learning classification techniques can significantly benefit the medical field by providing an accurate and quick diagnosis of diseases.

The intuition for this classificaltion is identify weather a patient is tested positive or negative given the diagnostic measurement presented in the dataset.

## Dataset Description 
I imported [Cardiovascular Disease dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset) from Kaggle. 
The dataset consists of 70 000 records of patients data in 12 features, such as age, gender, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and etc. The target class "cardio" equals to 1, when patient has cardiovascular desease, and it's 0, if patient is healthy.

## EDA
first step, is to take a look on the features and their values.

All data types in this dataset are numerical, so I didn't have to use dummy variables or one hot encoding.

Since the data entires for the age column are given in days, I converted them into years to better understand these values.
As you can see from the plot below, people older than 55 are pron to having CVD.

Since gender is expresed by 1 and 2, I wanted to distinguish which refers to women and which to men.
To do so, I calculated the mean height per gender and based my assutimation on the fact that the mean height for men would be higher than women. 
So I assume that 1 stands for women and 2 for men.

I wanted to know the percentage of population per gender. 
Women cover 65% and men 34%

Most imoportantly, I wnated to make sure that my target class distribution is balanced. And it was!

## Data Cleaning
Before I dive into the cleaning part, lets have a little backstory on blood pressure readings. 

Blood pressure is recorded as two numbers:
* Systolic blood pressure (the first number) – indicates how much pressure your blood is exerting against your artery walls when the heart beats.
* Diastolic blood pressure (the second number) – indicates how much pressure your blood is exerting against your artery walls while the heart is resting between beats.
Reference: [American Heart Association (AHA)](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/understanding-blood-pressure-readings)

As a result, I removed outliers, such as:
- Removing cases where Diastolic pressure is greater than Systolic.
- Removing negative blood pressure 
- Removing systolic blood pressure outside the range of (70 - 190 ), and diastolic outside the range (40 - 100 ).
